# WooCommerce-Assets-Conditional-Loader
<p>This WordPress plugin snippet conditionally unloads WooCommerce assets on non-WooCommerce pages, helping to optimize the loading speed of your site. By default, WooCommerce can load its scripts and styles on every page, even if the page doesnâ€™t need them. With this enhancement, WooCommerce assets will only load on WooCommerce-related pages, reducing unnecessary requests and improving performance.</p><h2>Features:</h2><ul><li>Checks if WooCommerce is active on your site.</li><li>Unloads WooCommerce assets on non-WooCommerce pages.</li><li>Improves website performance by reducing unnecessary asset loading.</li></ul><h2>Installation:</h2><ol><li>Copy the provided code into your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file or as a standalone plugin.</li><li>Navigate your website; WooCommerce assets will now load only on relevant pages.</li></ol><h2>Usage:</h2><p>After installing:</p><ol><li>WooCommerce assets will automatically be dequeued on non-WooCommerce pages.</li><li>Visit any non-WooCommerce page on your site and inspect the source.
